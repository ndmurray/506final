STEPS

1. Successfully request data that includes article abstracts (or 'descriptions') based on begin date, end date, some kind of QUERTY WORD, this will be a user input word

BONUS: If there's time, make the date fields user input as well.

2. Build functions that do the data requesting for both sources

3. Build in the caching functionality, this should be one cache file for requests from both sources, as each request will be pulling from both sources

4. Define your article classes for both sources, that pull an emotional score out of the descriptions as methods, among other things you need for the CSV file in step 5

5. Define the CSV output function that pulls emotional score (also perhaps with positive and negative scores), date, author, source
